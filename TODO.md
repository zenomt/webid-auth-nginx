TODO
====
  - documentation
  - better logging
  - pay attention to Cache-Control directives for caching group graphs
  - session and token admin tools
  - maybe improve client.py to keep DB of tokens, be more like curl
  - maybe implement webid_tls_endpoint
    - also implement WebID-TLS+cookies for first-party access?
